College sexual assault is an unavoidable topic on any campus. It is estimated that 20 - 25\% of women nationally report being sexually assaulted at some point during their college careers \cite{fisher_sexual_2000}. At Duke, this figure is closer to 40\%, as well as 10\% of men \cite{fox_university_2017} . Despite this, very few assaults are reported to police or to universities, for a number of reasons. A number of different measures have been taken by many schools to address campus sexual assault, including significant federal reform via Title IX reform in 2011, which affected almost every school in the US. These changes aimed to make reporting easier for an assault victim, thus increasing reports and hopefully, in equilibrium, decreasing assault.

There was a massive increase in reporting at schools in the years following these 2011 changes, as can be seen in Figure 1 below. This paper hopes to dive into this increase and consider the different ways in which 2011 may have increased reports both to police and to schools. More generally, this paper seeks to investigate the link between discourse around sexual assault and reporting of sexual assault. \todo{This is obviously way too terse an introduction. I want to wait to flesh this out until I have all results in front of me and have decided the angle I want to take.}

\section{Background}

The background section of \cite{lindo_any_2018} provides a more complete background to the 'Dear Colleague' letter and its effects - here I will summarize their points. 

Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 was intended to 'assure equal access to education,' originally focused on female college sport. It has been reinterpreted in the form of 'Dear Colleague' letters, which are sent by the OCR, and allow slight changes in the law without congressional approval by framing the changes as 'clarifications'. The 2011 letter that this paper will focus on stated that Title IX required, among other things, that:

\begin{itemize}

\item If a school knew or "reasonably should know" of sexual harassment or assault, it was to conduct a "prompt, thorough, and impartial" investigation \cite{ali_dear_2011}.

\item These investigations would use a "preponderance of evidence standard," which requires less proof than the standards of normal courts \cite{lindo_any_2018}

\item If the investigation found that sexual harassment or assault had occurred, the school was to "take immediate action to eliminate the hostile environment, prevent its reoccurrence, and address its effects"  \cite{ali_dear_2011}. 

\end{itemize}

Any victim that felt these steps had not been taken could file a complaint with the OCR which would trigger an investigation by the OCR into the way that school handled sexual harassment and assault. These cases are high profile, generating a large amount of press about the universities in question \cite{lindo_any_2018}. 

In addition to these changes in 2011, the OCR made a number of further changes to policy in the following years, including putting more effort into getting mandatory reporters to report. Any employee of a university that receives federal funding is required to report to the school's Title IX coordinator any crime that is reported to them by a student, which will then be recorded in CSS statistics. In the years after 2011, the OCR increased efforts to enforce this rule . This enforcement could drive an increase in reports in the data without an actual increase in reports to staff.

These measures were taken in 2011 in response to a number of private documentaries and investigations that emphasized the nationwide injustices that victims face, the lack of repercussions for perpetrators and difficulty victims face while reporting. One key metric, then, to evaluate how well the policy has worked is report rates before and after the Letter was released. When reporting, a victim faces the choice of reporting to the police or to the university. A police report will usually lead to an investigation that is hugely costly to both the victim and the accused - something that most victims wish to avoid. Before 2011, a university report would lead to a number of different outcomes at different universities, but usually there would be an investigation that was still costly especially to the victim. The intention of the changes in 2011 were to make this university investigation less difficult for the victim. This paper will look at how this change in university investigation procedures has affected the reporting rates of victims both to universities and to the police.

The issue of non-reporting has been especially salient over the past weeks, as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has been accused of crimes that were not reported at the time. President Trump tweeted in response to the claims: "I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents" \citeyear{trump_i_2018}. There are clearly many reasons why an individual may not report: social pressures, abusive relationships, and fear of not being believed, for example. More importantly, however, this tweet illustrates a source of motivation for this paper: had Dr. Ford reported when the crime had been committed, her testimony now would be more impervious to detractors. There are many reasons that increased reporting would be a desirable outcome - this is just one of them. 



\section{Literature Review}

Since Becker outlined his economic model of crime, illicit activities have continued to have a place in the economic literature. Sexual assault has received a share of this attention, although perhaps less so than other crimes. One reason for this deficit is the difficulty of gathering accurate data on sexual assault. Crime is underreported in general, sexual assault especially \cite{kilpatrick_drug-facilitated_2007} \cite{fisher_sexual_2000}. Recently, however, several economics papers have focused on sexual assault and harassment. 

\citeA{allen_reporting_2007} investigates the factors that influence an individual's decision to report a rape to law enforcement using survey data from The National Sample of Rape Victims, completed in 1985 and released in 2000, and finds that victims will be more likely to report sexual assault given more 'social support and ancillary evidence associated with the crime.' This paper is important to this investigation as it shows that the decision to report is influenced by factors that may be affected by policy, and thus supports the notion that policy to ease the reporting process could be beneficial. It is also some of the only research done on what affects the individual's decision to report. Given that I will be diving deeper into reasons this decision may have been made more often after 2011, this seems especially important to my investigation.

\citeA{yung_concealing_2015} investigates the idea that universities undercount reports in order to save face.  Comparing report numbers from years before and after an audit by the OCR, the paper estimates a consistent 40\% uptick in reports by universities in the year of an audit, followed by a return to preexisting trends the year directly after an audit. This is relevant for my paper, as this undercounting could affect the accuracy of the CSS data I am using, although the homogeneity found in undercounting indicates that it should not lead to bad estimates.

\citeA{lindo_college_2018} looks at the effect of partying culture on reports of sexual assault. Specifically, using the plausible exogeneity of Division 1 football games, the paper estimates the effects of increased partying that comes with such events on reports of rape to law enforcement. The authors find a 28\% increase in rape reports associated with game days. Estimates are higher when the opponent is a rival, when the game is a Home rather than Away game, and when the game is televised. This paper is useful as it is a recent, high profile economics paper on the causes of sexual assault on college campuses, and for its use of NBIRS data, which will allow my paper to make use of this data much more easily.

\citeA{lindo_any_2018} considers the effects of a Title IX investigation on a universities outcomes such as enrolment, applications, degree completion and donations. Their estimates show significant upticks in both enrolment and applications following an investigation, with no evidence of effects on degree completion or donations. As part of their analysis, they use Google Trends data as a proxy for public awareness of investigations, concluding that the investigations are indeed in the public spotlight, even while federal policy on sexual assault may not be. The paper has an in-depth background of the 2011 Title IX changes that is very useful for my paper, as well as being closely related in subject. 

\section{Data Summary and Initial Regressions}

The most important data source that this paper will use is Campus Safety and Security (CSS) data collected and distributed by the Department of Education . Under the Clery act, any university that uses federal student financial aid - which is almost every university in the US - must disclose details about the reports of crime that it receives every year. This data catalogues these reports by school, year and type of crime from 2005 to 2016. There are 7,663 unique universities that span the entire time span, including 1,096 with more than 5000 students and 563 with more than 10,000. In 2016, 8,991 sexual crimes were reported in total. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the general trend of reports by year.  

\section{Methodology and Results}

First, I want to see whether reports to police increase in a county when reports are high to a school in that county. To consider this, I estimate the equation:

$$ 
p_{i,t} = \alpha_{i} + \beta s_{i,t} + \gamma{t} + \varepsilon_{i,t}
$$

Where $p_{it}$ are reports per capita of a station in question's area and year in question; $s_{it}$ are reports per student for the school and year in question; and $\alpha_{i}$ and $\gamma{t}$ are school and year fixed-effects. The results are shown in Table 1. The coefficient is 0.131, statistically significant at the 10\% level. Thus, with constant populations, 8 extra reporters to schools in a county should result in 1 extra report to police. \todo{Is this right? Kind of get confused with per capita stuff} This seems reasonable, and gives some evidence to the idea that school and police reports are substitutes. 

Next, I want to check the salience of Title IX Investigations using Google Trends. \citeA{lindo_any_2018} does this using terms like "Penn State Sexual Assault," but I want to check salience in a general sense. Do these investigations cause enough fuss to dent trends for a search as general as "sexual assault?" To investigate, I run two regressions. The first is a daily time series of reports to police and Google Trends:

$$
T_{t} = \alpha_{t} + \gamma_{t} + \rho_{t} + \sum_{b=-7}^{7} \delta_{b} TitleIX_{t+b} + \varepsilon_{t}
$$

Where $T_{t}$ is the Google Trend for "sexual assault" on day t, $\alpha_{t}$, $\gamma_{t}$ and $\rho_{t}$ are year, week-of-year and day-of-week fixed effects, and $TitleIX_{t+b}$ is a set of leads, lags and dates of Title IX investigations being opened. 

The results are shown in Figure 2. There is a possible uptick on the date of a case opening, but it falls well outside the window of statistical significance. Thus, we do not find evidence of significant national salience of these cases with a general search term. To investigate local salience, we run the following week-by-state panel regression:

$$
T_{i,t} = \alpha_{t} + \gamma_{t} + \rho_{i} + \sum_{b=-7}^{7} \delta_{b} TitleIX_{i,t+b} + \varepsilon_{t}
$$

Where $T_{t}$ is the Google Trend for "sexual assault" on day t in state i, $\alpha_{t}$, $\gamma_{t}$ and $\rho_{i}$ are year, week-of-year and state fixed effects, and $TitleIX_{t+b}$ is a set of leads, lags and dates of Title IX investigations being opened in state i. 

The results are shown in Figure 2. As can be seen, statewide trends increase above normal for a few weeks before a case is opened and for at least 7 weeks after, by about 3 points (Trends are a relative score out of 100), statistically significant at the 5 percent level. Thus, these cases seem to be salient, if not at the national level, then certainly at the state level.
