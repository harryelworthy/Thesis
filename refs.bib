	abstract = {The findings show that approximately 20 million out of 112 million women (18 percent) in the United States have ever been raped, including an estimated 18 million women who have been forcibly raped, nearly 3 million who have experienced drug-facilitated rape, and 3 million who have been raped while incapacitated. Only 16 percent of all rapes were reported to law enforcement. Victims of drug-facilitated or rape while they were incapacitated were somewhat less likely to report the rape to authorities than victims of forcible rape. Major barriers to reporting rape included not wanting others to know about the rape, fear of retaliation, perception that evidence was insufficient, uncertainty about how to report the crime, and uncertainty about whether a crime was committed or whether the offender intended her harm. Injury was reported for 52 percent of forcible rape incidents and 30 percent of drug-facilitated or incapacitated rape incidents. Approximately 673,000 of nearly 6 million current college women (11.5 percent) have ever been raped, with an estimated half-million college women having been forcibly raped, 160,000 experiencing drug-facilitated rape, and just over 200,000 having been raped while incapacitated. Among college women, approximately 12 percent of rapes were reported to law enforcement. Consistent with the national sample, victims of drug-facilitated or incapacitated rape were less likely than victims of forcible rape to report it to police. Reasons for not reporting the rape were similar to those for nonreporting in the national sample. 52 exhibits and 51 references},

	abstract = {A rape victim possesses a scarce resource: information about the crime. Thus, a victim's decision to report the crime to police, to allocate that resource, becomes an economic choice. A victim cannot receive social support or legal justice without revealing such information, but doing so creates real costs-social recrimination and lost privacy-with no guarantee of offender apprehension. This article explores the economics of the reporting and chronic nonreporting of rape in the context of this information-allocation problem. The empirical analysis addresses the extent to which social-support availability and evidentiary factors influence the reporting decision. Dichotomous and multinomial logit results, obtained using National Crime Survey data on a sample of rape victims, reveal how various demographic and crime-specific factors explain the decision to report and the selection of specific reasons for not reporting. Some of these factors reflect circumstances addressable as matters of procedure or policy.},

Using a random utility framework, I estimate that women are willing to choose a college in the bottom half of the quality distribution over a college in the top quintile for a route that is perceived to be one standard deviation (SD) safer. Alternatively, women are willing to spend an additional INR 18,800 (USD 290) per year, relative to men, for a route that is one SD safer - an amount equal to double the average annual college tuition. These findings have implications for other economic decisions made by women. For example, it could help explain the puzzle of low female labor force participation in India.},

In addition to the study of sexual victimization, the study investigated how rape estimates that use the two-stage process of behaviorally specific questions and incident reports compared with estimates drawn from survey responses. The study results were based on a telephone survey of a randomly selected national sample of 4,446 college women in 1996. Twelve types of sexual victimization, from completed rape through stalking and verbal forms of sexual victimization, were studied. Survey responses suggest that many students encounter sexist and harassing comments and that many have a good chance of  being stalked or enduring some form of coerced sexual contact. During any given academic year, 2.8\% of women will experience a completed or attempted rape. Study results also show that a methodology that uses behaviorally specific screen questions in combination with an incident report yields considerably higher estimates of completed, attempted, and threatened rape than are found using the telephone methodology of NCVS. Most sexual victimization occurred when college women were alone with a man they know, at night, and in the privacy of a residence. Several factors appeared to increase the likelihood of being victimized. (Contains 14 exhibits and 37 endnotes.) (SLD)},

	abstract = {This study tests whether there is substantial undercounting of sexual assault by universities. It compares
the sexual assault data submitted by universities while being audited for Clery Act violations with the
data from years before and after such audits. If schools report higher rates of sexual assault during times
of higher regulatory scrutiny (audits), then that result would support the conclusion that universities are
failing to accurately tally incidents of sexual assault during other time periods. The study finds that
university reports of sexual assault increase by approximately 44\% during the audit period. After the
audit is completed, the reported sexual assault rates drop to levels statistically indistinguishable from the
preaudit time frame. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the ordinary practice of
universities is to undercount incidents of sexual assault. Only during periods in which schools are audited
do they appear to offer a more complete picture of sexual assault levels on campus. Further, the data
indicate that the audits have no long-term effect on the reported levels of sexual assault, as those crime
rates return to previous levels after the audit is completed. This last finding is supported even in instances
when fines are issued for noncompliance. The study tests for a similar result with the tracked crimes of
aggravated assault, robbery, and burglary, but reported crimes show no statistically significant differences before, during, or after audits. The results of the study point toward 2 broader conclusions
directly relevant to policymaking in this area. First, greater financial and personnel resources should
be allocated commensurate with the severity of the problem and not based solely on university
reports of sexual assault levels. Second, the frequency of auditing should be increased, and
statutorily capped fines should be raised to deter transgressors from continuing to undercount sexual
violence. The Campus Accountability and Safety Act, presently before Congress, provides an
important step in that direction.},

	abstract = {Contrary to the traditional image of college campuses as safe havens for young adults, students, and women
in particular, are exposed to high risks of sexual victimization on campus (Fisher, Cullen, \& Turner, 2000;
Fisher et al., 1998; Koss, Gidycz, \& Wisniewski, 1987). Obtaining a postsecondary education should be a
time for healthy risk-taking and for social, intellectual and vocational maturation. Victims of campus sexual
assault, however, face potential traumatization{\textemdash}intense fear and emotional numbing, loss of control, and
the shattering of their trust and their belief in their ability to make sound judgements about the people and
the world around them. The cost of this potential loss is inestimable.
During the last fifteen years, the issue of sexual victimization of students has attracted much needed
attention partially through highly publicized campus sexual assault trials and allegations of reports being
mishandled by school officials (Bohmer \& Parrot, 1993; Sanday, 1990, 1996; Warshaw, 1988). In response
to public pressure, Federal legislation has mandated that institutions of higher education grapple with{\textemdash}and
respond to{\textemdash}the massive problem of young men{\textquoteright}s sexual violence toward their coeducational peers. (In this
summary, we will refer to institutions of high education with the acronym, {\textquotedblleft}IHE{\textquotedblright}).
Congress passed the Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act (20 U.S.C. {\textsection}1092) in 1990 to require
all Title IV eligible IHEs to publicly disclose crime statistics and crime prevention and security policies and
procedures on campus. The law was amended in 1992 to require that schools afford victims specific basic
rights and again in 1998 to emphasize reporting obligations regarding sexual assault on campus1. This most
recent amendment is commonly known as the Clery Act.
Despite the emergence of concern about sexual victimization among postsecondary students, little systematic
information has been published about the content of sexual assault policies, protocols, and programs that
currently exist in IHEs. In Public Law 105-244, the United States Congress mandated a study designed to
address nine issues relating to prevention efforts, victim support services, reporting policies, protocols,
barriers, and facilitators, adjudication procedures, and sanctions for sexual assault. On
1 November 1999, the National Institute of Justice awarded a grant to Education Development Center, Inc.,
and its partners{\textemdash}University of Cincinnati and Police Executive Research Forum{\textemdash}to carry out this study.},

The results indicated that victims were significantly more likely to report a rape if the offender had used physical force and if the victim had received medical attention for injuries sustained during the commission of the crime.

	abstract = {[Using a combination of hypothetical scenarios and survey-type questions, this study investigates the effect of the context of the offense, formal sanctions, informal sanctions, and moral beliefs on self-reported projections to commit sexual assault. Male college students read and responded to five scenarios each describing a hypothetical sexual assault by a male. Respondents were asked to estimate the certainty of formal and informal punishment for the scenario male, the extent to which they believed the male's actions were morally wrong, and the likelihood that they would do what the male did under the same circumstances. We found that projections to commit sexual assault were affected by two circumstances of the incident, the likelihood that the male would be formally sanctioned (dismissed from the university or arrested) and the respondent's moral beliefs. The significant deterrent effect observed for formal sanction threats was not invariant, however. The fear of formal sanctions had no effect when respondents were inhibited by their moral evaluation of the incident. The deterrent effect of formal sanction threats did not vary by the level of social censure for the scenario male's actions. The implications of these finding for previous and subsequent deterrence research are discussed.]},

	abstract = {Using recently released data from the redesigned National Crime Victimization Survey from 1992 to 1994, this article examines those factors related to the probability of a rape victimization being reported to police and the subsequent probability of an arrest being made. The contextual characteristics examined were the victim-offender relationship, injuries sustained by victims, weapon use by offenders, marital status and age of victim, and location of occurrence. Analyses focused exclusively on one-on-one incidents of rape against adult women perpetrated by males. The only factors that appeared to significantly increase the likelihood of a rape victimization being reported to police was if the victim sustained physical injuries in addition to the rape and if the offender used a weapon. None of the contextual factors were significant in predicting the probability of police making an arrest. Implications for policy and the effectiveness of rape law reforms are discussed.},

	abstract = {A total of 293 findings from 42 studies on the impact of publicized suicide stories in the media on the incidence of suicide in the real world were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Studies measuring the effect of either an entertainment or political celebrity suicide story were 14.3 times more likely to find a copycat effect than studies that did not. Studies based on a real as opposed to fictional story were 4.03 times more likely to uncover a copycat effect. Research based on televised stories was 82\% less likely to report a copycat effect than research based on newspapers. A review of recent events in Austria and Switzerland indicates that suicide prevention organizations can successfully convince the media to change the frequency and content of their suicide coverage in an effort to reduce copycat effects.},
